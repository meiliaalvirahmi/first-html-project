    <p1>Here are some interesting accomplishments about me:</p1>

    <ul>
        <li>I once won a gaming tournament when I was six. We played Sonic & Knuckles.</li>
        <li>I ate burritos with the band Sugarcult. I don't even like Sugarcult. The burritos are the highlight of this story.</li>
        <li>I am one of the very few people to never graduate college nor ever take the standardized test GMAT and yet still be accepted into a master's program.</li>
    </ul>
